## Issue 1:

Local Hooks: 

	1) Pre-commit Hook - import GitPython library 
	To create symlink file:
	run command prompt as administrator and then use 'mklink' command:
	- mklink path to this->\.git\hooks\pre-commit path to this->\hooks\pre-commit.py

	2) Prepare Commit Message Hook
	run command prompt as administrator and then use 'mklink' command:
	- mklink path to this->\.git\hooks\prepare-commit-msg path to this->\hooks\prepare-commit-msg.py

	3) Commit Message Hook
	run command prompt as administrator and then use 'mklink' command:
	- mklink path to this->\.git\hooks\commit-msg path to this->\hooks\commit-msg.py
